        Hi, my name is Nick, and I am a student and developer. This is a portfolio to show off my various projects.

        Unity and C#
      </h2>
      <p class="textp">
          I am currently learning C# for Unity game developement, and I have made a small game through following a tutorial. It is an Angry Birds clone called "Disgruntled Bird." Below, you can see some gameplay from it.
          I am also working on some other projects in Unity currently, some of which I hope to release either on Steam or the Google Play Store in the future.

        Android Studio and Java
      </h2>
      <p class="textp">
          I am also learning how to use Android Studio and how to program in Java and XML. I have touched on Kotlin a small bit, but right now I am mainly focused on Java.
          I have made a couple small apps in Android Studio, a Random number picker app, and a more advanced app that lets you search for github repos. The latter is demonstrating the ability to connect to the Internet through an app.
          I am following a course on Android Studio developement in Udacity, and I am also making a weather app "Pixel Weather" that utilizes Open Weather Map's free Weather API. I hope to launch this app on the Play Store and maybe make a little bit of money.
