      Android Studio and Java

          I am also learning how to use Android Studio and how to program in Java and XML. I have touched on Kotlin a small bit, but right now I am mainly focused on Java.
          I have made a couple small apps in Android Studio, a Random number picker app, and a more advanced app that lets you search for github repos. The latter is demonstrating the ability to connect to the Internet through an app.
          I am following a course on Android Studio developement in Udacity, and I am also making a weather app "Pixel Weather" that utilizes Open Weather Map's free Weather API. I hope to launch this app on the Play Store and maybe make a little bit of money.
