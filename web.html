          I am also teaching myself web development. I have made this website you are on right now using no frameworks or website builders, just pure HTML5 and CSS. If you want to check out the source code, it is all in my Github (linked below). Another web project I made is a basic todo list site, that allows the user to enter items into a list, and click on them to take them off the list when they have completed the todo. This was my first time using Javascript, and I think it turned out nicely. I have embedded a demo video of it below!

          Toolbox: Atom Code Editor, Github, and Firefox and Edge for testing my sites.
